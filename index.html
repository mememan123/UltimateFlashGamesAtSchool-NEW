<p align="center">Hey, it's me, Ruby Kenny, the creator of Ultimate Flash Games 
at School and its many remade versions. </p>
<p align="center">First off I would just like to say Thank You to everyone who 
stuck around this long, I never expected my little website that I created on a 
rainy day in 6th grade</p>
<p align="center">to become this popular. And I hope some of you have kept 
around with all my updates and site moves over the years.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">I'm now a Junior in High School, and while making this website 
was fun, it just isn't as easy to maintain as before. Ruffle, while amazing, 
isn't compatible with</p>
<p align="center">most of the classic flash games from the old sites, and as a 
result the library of games has gone down exponentially. GitHub Pages is slow 
and annoying to use,</p>
<p align="center">and Neocities requires payment just so i can F**king upload an 
SWF. Google Sites was really the best option but sadly, a lot of Firewalls for 
schools have</p>
<p align="center">blocked any google sites made with &quot;Game&quot; or &quot;Unblocked&quot; in 
the title, which is why I moved to GeoCities and then GitHub, but as i already 
said they</p>
<p align="center">have their problems which didn't motivate me to update often, 
and also gave me stress because I felt I was letting my audience down by 
updating infrequently. </p>
<p align="center">I also just don't have much free time anymore, I'm busy doing 
other things or hanging out with friends, and the website kinda just fell to the 
wayside.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">And unfortunately, with the way the internet is changing, 
Unblocked Games sites are dying. and i don't want to be stuck in 2016 still</p>
<p align="center">making a site for old flash games when better options exist.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">If you want to find me elsewhere, i'm on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCImiKvwxWiODInXAsOBxkpw">YouTube</a> 
and <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperRainboom">Twitter</a>. my discord is 
SupersonicRainboom#6537</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">I might make a new site on Neocities, but until then, thanks 
for playing.</p>
